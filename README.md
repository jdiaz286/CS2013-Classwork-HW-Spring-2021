 Purpose     |  For this assignment you will be implementing a program which can read a PPMImage and alter its pixel data to manipulate how the image looks.  You will use Binary IO to process the image. 
PPMImage.java     |  This class is meant to serve as the basis for reading a PPMImage and altering its pixel data to manipulate how the image looks.
PPMImages     |  This is a folder that holds 8 different ppm images to test the program.

## hw02 folder includes:
Class name  | Task
-------------    | -------------
 Purpose     |  The purpose of this assignment is to have you practice using Java Generics to create your own generic class.  You are required to do this assignment in Java, since Generics is a Java only topic.  Do not forget to include the header comment at the top of each .java file you submit.
Main.java     |  This class is meant to test the generic array created.
MyArray.java     |  This class is meant to represent the generic array that is used in the array.
Student.java     |  This is a class that is meant to represent a student to test the generic array.

 Purpose     |  For this assignment you will be implementing a program which can read a PPMImage and alter its pixel data to manipulate how the image looks.  You will use Binary IO to process the image. 
FileReader.java     |  This class is meant to read a file of 'Hexagons' with different colors.
Hexagon.java     |  This class is meant to represent a Hexagon that is to be stored in an ArrayList.
SolutionFinder.java     |  This is a class that is meant to find a solution to the set of hexagons given.
SolutionFinderDriver.java     |  This is a class that just runs the program.
