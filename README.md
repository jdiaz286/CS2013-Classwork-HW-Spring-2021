 Purpose     |  For this assignment you will be implementing a program which can read a PPMImage and alter its pixel data to manipulate how the image looks.  You will use Binary IO to process the image. 
PPMImage.java     |  This class is meant to serve as the basis for reading a PPMImage and altering its pixel data to manipulate how the image looks.
PPMImages     |  This is a folder that holds 8 different ppm images to test the program.
